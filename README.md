# Bike Share Mini Project Repo

This repository is for the Bike Share Mini Project. The main goal of the project is to predict bike usage (hourly/daily) based on other features such as season, temperature, whether it's a holiday or not, etc. 

Important changes to project repo:

* README.md file created under main repo Bikeshare/
* "1_DataWrangling.ipynb" created under Notebooks/ (Please note - the code in this notbook creates 2 .csv files in a specified directory. This directory must be changed appropriately for the code to run)
* Created .html version of "1_DataWrangling.ipynb"
* 2 new .csv files created under Data/ - "daily_clean.csv" and "hourly_clean.csv"
* Created "2_EDA.ipynb" and .html version as well in the Notebooks/ repo
* Created "3_Modeling.ipynb" and .html version as well in the Notebooks/ repo
* Created "Project_Report.ipynb" and .html version in Deliver/ repo
* Updated 3_Modeling.ipynb which now creates two .csv files with predictions data. The csv files are in Data/.
